# SQL-and-ERDs
In this repository, you will see some SQL work and entity-relationship diagrams (in Chen's or Crow's Foot Notation) that I have created.
Most of these projects were completed with prompts for IST 210: Organization of Data or DS 220: Data Management for Data Science at Penn State. My final project for DS 220 used the World Happiness Report from the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network to compare and contrast SQL and NoSQL (MongoDB) tools for aggregation and querying.
